            Arete is an Alternative Rock/Pop Rock band based in Washington, DC,
            established in 2023. The band features Luke Schwarz as the lead
            vocalist, pianist, and lyricist, alongside Jonah Surotchak as the
            lead guitarist and backing vocalist.
            <br />
            Luke brings 13 years of self-taught piano experience, having
            developed his skills by ear rather than through traditional sheet
            music. He began composing music to complement his poetry and has
            performed at various professional functions and hired events. Jonah
            has spent the last five years teaching himself the guitar with a
            focus on folk punk, and also serves as a session musician for
            colleagues and their bands during his time overseas each summer.
            <br />
            Together, they formed Arete and are currently in the process of
            developing their debut album, “The First and the Many.”
